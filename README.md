# The Hot New Job 

An article that I found interesting was
[The Hot New Job That Pays Six Figures](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/11/the-hot-new-job-that-pays-six-figures-ai-prompt-engineering/?sh=4d84a5ed7d7f).

*The article covers how prompt engineering is the hottest job lately, and I found it intriguing how it mentioned that people looking to hire prompt engineers aren't looking for those who are especially technically knowledgeable.*

<p>Since the rise of LLMs like GPT, I've personally found that prompt engineering takes a lot of creativity and many many iterations to create a solid prompt that outputs exactly what you want. </p>

Earlier this year, my friend and I did an experiment to see if we could switch roles in creating a web application. While usually he would do the design side of things and I would do the coding, we swapped roles and he used chatGPT to code the application, and I used Midjourney to help me design components for the frontend. Here was our final result: [Personify](https://personify.bio/) . I was very impressed that having little previous coding background, he got a basic working web application completed within a week. 

<p>I think it's interesting that perhaps those who study humanities or other less technical fields might have a leg up in a way compared to technical people in this new age of technology. With the rise in AI, different technologies are definitely more accessible to people who might not have access otherwise. Maybe alongside more 'software engineering' courses, we might one day also add 'prompt engineering' courses to the curriculum :)</p>

As someone who uses ChatGPT extensively, I truly think that Prompt Engineering is a skill that not everyone has. ChatGPT works the best when the user is great at explaining and also clear about what they intend to achieve in a given prompt (e.g. Write a for loop that finds for an array that finds x). This skill is very similar to Googling, where skilled 'Googlers' are able to find information at higher efficiencies and accuracies than others. I think that these skills are very underrated; I'm glad that they seem to be posting jobs and recognizing the importance of it. Here's a question to ponder about: In our modern world, is it more important to know the information or know how to find the information?

As someone who grew up around an adult that possessed a degree in Computer Science and also a Googling profiency that I've never been able master yet, I've always been impressed by their ability to Google software questions and retrieve answers that I couldn't find even though I could've sworn that they were looking up the same subjects. Somehow their search results would always provide solutions that solved the issue straightforwardly, while my results were often over-complicated solutions that weren't always relevant to the original question. These experiences are the first that came to mind when I read this article and do make me believe that prompt engineering may play an important role in future jobs. Perhaps not as a fully fledged position with a prompt engineer title, but rather an addition to the general toolbox of knowledge that one must have when entering a particular job.
